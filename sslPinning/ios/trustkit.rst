TrustKit is an open-source framework designed to facilitate the implementation of SSL public key pinning and reporting in mobile applications. It enhances the security of network connections by ensuring that an app only communicates with servers whose public keys match pre-defined, expected keys.

Why it is used in React Native:

In React Native applications, TrustKit is employed to bolster the security of network communications, particularly when dealing with sensitive data. Mobile apps, including those built with React Native, are susceptible to various network attacks like Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker intercepts communication between the app and the server.
TrustKit helps mitigate these risks by:

SSL Pinning:
It allows developers to "pin" specific public keys or certificate hashes of the expected servers within the application. This means that even if a malicious actor tries to present a fake certificate from a compromised Certificate Authority (CA), TrustKit will detect the mismatch and prevent the connection, protecting the app's data.

Reporting:
TrustKit includes a reporting feature that can send alerts or reports when a pin validation fails. This provides valuable insights into potential security breaches or network anomalies, allowing developers to monitor and respond to threats effectively.

By integrating TrustKit into a React Native project, developers can significantly enhance the security posture of their applications, safeguarding user data and maintaining the integrity of sensitive transactions.
